Weblegs PHP Framework
=============

It's an application framework, and HTML binding engine and a user system. For the UI we integrated Twitter's Bootstrap and some jQuery. That's right, it's glorious.

Dubbed "Footprint" due to its small size. 1.2mb (as of 2/5/12) including 3rd party libs and the MySQL structure dump. It packs a serious punch for being so small.

Installation
-------

You'll need apache and mysql. We suggest you set it up as it's own host instead of a sub-directory.

Watch out, PHP's `xsl` extension is required for the template engine to run properly.

Configure via /app/config.php

Enjoy!

Documentation
------------

The framework isn't documented very much, meaning at all. We will be updating that soon.
