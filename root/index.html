	            	<h3><a href="root/users/index.html">Users</a></h3>
            		<p>You may grant users membership to groups. You may grant security permissions to users granularly to override the settings found in the users' group permissions.</p>
                	<pre>[1] If a group has permission to a security setting then any user who is a current member of that group also has permission.</pre>
                	<pre>[2] If you need a user to be a member of a group but don't want the user to have a specific permission that the group does has permission to, you may deny access to the user individually from the user details > permissions screen.</pre>
	            	
	            	<h3><a href="root/groups/index.html">User Groups</a></h3>
            		<p>What you'll do most of the time is grant permissions to user groups. The users in a group will inherit the group's permission settings.</p>
	            	
	            	<h3><a href="root/group-categories/index.html">Group Categories</a></h3>
            		<p>It also helps to organize your groups into categories. For example you could have an "employee" category and use the different groups in that category as the departments of a company.</p>

            		<p>Security settings are an important part of Footprint. Developers who work on the application will be the ones who put the security settings into place.</p>
                	<pre>[1] Deleting or modifying these settings could cause irreversible damage or a lot of headaches for the developer. You've been warned.</pre>
            		
	            	<h3><a href="root/ip-access/index.html">IP Access</a></h3>
            		<p>This area allows you to add trusted IP addresses to the application. All other IP addresses will be denied access (when using "require-session"). This is a great feature for organizations that don't want users logging in from outside a specific location.</p>
                	<pre>[1] Don't forget about the "May Skip IP Check" security setting! Some web applications have users logging in from unknown locations, and that's ok.  Just grant this permission to groups or users who should skip IP address validation.</pre>

            		<p>Developers of the application install history log functions for certain actions and/or events users make. After installed they generated logs can be found here.</p>
            		<h3><a href="root/errors/index.html">Errors</a></h3>
            		<p>If error logging is turned on, you can view all errors that the system was able to catch. You can search, view, download and delete these error logs.
